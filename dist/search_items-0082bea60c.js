Consuming Dispatch Events To handle events, Remedy uses a GenStage implementation. Remedy defines the producer and producer_consumer in the GenStage design. To consume the events you must create at least one consumer process. Remedy uses a ConsumerSupervisor to dispatch events, meaning your handlers will each be ran in their own seperate task. The full list of dispatch events and their inner payload is described in the type specs within this module. Regular payloads are delivered after casting to their schema and ratified against the cache. Irregular payloads are classified as those which do not directly map to a standard discord object. They undergo extensive manipulation prior to updating the cache. They are described under the DISPATCH section of the documentation. Example It is recommended that you supervise your consumers. First we set up a supervisor module for our consumers. #example_supervisor.ex defmodule MyApp.ExampleSupervisor do use Supervisor def start_link ( args ) do Supervisor . start_link ( __MODULE__ , args , name : __MODULE__ ) end @impl true def init ( _init_arg ) do children = [ ExampleConsumer ] Supervisor . init ( children , strategy : :one_for_one ) end end You can then set up your consumer module. #example_consumer.ex defmodule ExampleConsumer do use Remedy.Consumer alias Remedy.Api def start_link do Consumer . start_link ( __MODULE__ ) end def handle_event ( { :MESSAGE_CREATE , % Message { content : content } , _ws_state } ) do case content do &quot;!sleep&quot; -&gt; Api . create_message ( msg . channel_id , &quot;Going to sleep...&quot; ) Process . sleep ( 3000 ) &quot;!ping&quot; -&gt; Api . create_message ( msg . channel_id , &quot;pyongyang!&quot; ) &quot;!raise&quot; -&gt; raise &quot;No problems here!&quot; end end def handle_event ( _event ) do :noop end end","ref":"Remedy.Consumer.html","title":"Remedy.Consumer","type":"behaviour"},{"doc":"","ref":"Remedy.Consumer.html#c:handle_event/1","title":"Remedy.Consumer.handle_event/1","type":"callback"},{"doc":"Sent when a new channel is created.

The majority of the functions within this module are pulled directly from the Discord API. Some custom implementations are included. Some functions are useless in the scope of a bot and are intentionally omitted. Ratelimits Discord imposes rate limits in various capacities. The functions in this module will respect those rate limits where possible. In certain circumstances, discord will impose hidden rate limits to avoid abuse, which you can still hit. Bang! While intentionally undocumented to reduce clutter, all functions can be banged to return or raise. Audit Log Reason Many endpoints accept the X-Audit-Log-Reason header to provide a reason for the action. This is a string that is displayed in the audit log, limited to 512 characters. Due to Discords API documentation being sketchy, this header is not always accurately documented where it is accepted. Reasons for the audit log can be passed to discord via the reason: &quot;Some Audit Log Reason&quot; option. Routes that are known to accept this header are marked with the 📒 symbol. Casting vs Modifying Modifying an object will only change the given fields. Whereas casting will overwrite the entire array of objects. For example, if you have the following guild: iex&gt; Remedy.API . get_guild! ( 81384788765712384 ) % Remedy.Schema.Guild { id : 81384788765712384 , name : &quot;Remedy&quot; , icon : &quot;f817c5adaf96672c94a17de8e944f427&quot; , ... } Calling modify_guild(81384788765712384, name: &quot;New Remedy Server&quot;) will change the name to &quot;New Remedy Server&quot;, but will not change the icon. iex&gt; Remedy.API . modify_guild!

For example, if your guild is set up with the following application commands: iex&gt; Remedy.API . list_commands! ( 81384788765712384 ) [ %{ name : &quot;foo&quot; , description : &quot;Foo the bot&quot; } , %{ name : &quot;bar&quot; , description : &quot;Bar the bot&quot; } , %{ name : &quot;ping&quot; , description : &quot;Ping the bot&quot; } ] Casting the below will overwrite, update, and replace the entire array of commands. iex&gt; commands = [ %{ name : &quot;foo&quot; , description : &quot;Bar the bot&quot; } , %{ name : &quot;baz&quot; , description : &quot;baz the bot&quot; } ] ...&gt; Remedy.API . cast_commands!

They're accessible, customizable, and easy to use. There are several different types of components; this documentation will outline the basics of this new framework and each example.+ Components have been broken out into individual modules for easy distinction between them and to separate helper functions and individual type checking between component types - especially as more components are added by Discord. Each of the components are provided all of the valid types through this module to avoid repetition and allow new components to be added quicker and easier. Action Row An Action Row is a non-interactive container component for other types of components. It has a type: 1 and a sub-array of components of other types. You can have up to 5 Action Rows per message An Action Row cannot contain another Action Row An Action Row containing buttons cannot also contain a select menu Buttons Buttons are interactive components that render on messages. They have a type: 2 , They can be clicked by users. Buttons in Nostrum are further separated into two types, detailed below. Only the Interaction Button will fire a Nostrum.Struct.Interaction when pressed. Buttons must exist inside an Action Row An Action Row can contain up to 5 buttons An Action Row containing buttons cannot also contain a select menu For more information check out the Discord API Button Styles for more information. Link Buttons Link buttons do not send an interaction to your app when clicked Link buttons must have a url , and cannot have a custom_id Link buttons will always use style: 5 Link style: 5 Interaction Buttons ( Non-link Buttons ) Discord calls these buttons &quot;Non-link Buttons&quot; due to the fact that they do not contain a url. However it would be more accurate to call them an &quot;Interaction Button&quot; as they do fire an interaction when clicked which is far more useful for your applications interactivity. As such they are referred to as &quot;Interaction Button&quot; throughout the rest of this module. Interaction buttons must have a custom_id , and cannot have a url Can have one of the below :style applied. Primary style: 1 Secondary style: 2 Success style: 3 Danger style: 4 🐼 Emoji Buttons Note: The discord documentation and marketing material in relation to buttons indicates that there are three kinds of buttons: 🐼 Emoji Buttons , Link Buttons &amp; Non-Link Buttons . When in fact all buttons can contain an emoji. Because of this reason 🐼 Emoji Buttons are not included as a seperate type. Emojis will be instead handled by the two included ( superior ) button types. The field requirements are already becoming convoluted especially considering everything so far is all still a &quot;Component&quot;. Using the sub types and helper functions will ensure all of the rules are followed when creating components. Select Menu Select menus are another interactive component that renders on messages. On desktop, clicking on a select menu opens a dropdown-style UI; on mobile, tapping a select menu opens up a half-sheet with the options. Select menus support single-select and multi-select behavior, meaning you can prompt a user to choose just one item from a list, or multiple. When a user finishes making their choice by clicking out of the dropdown or closing the half-sheet, your app will receive an interaction. Select menus must be sent inside an Action Row An Action Row can contain only one select menu An Action Row containing a select menu cannot also contain buttons","ref":"Remedy.Schema.Component.html","title":"Remedy.Schema.Component","type":"behaviour"},{"doc":"","ref":"Remedy.Schema.Component.html#changeset/2","title":"Remedy.Schema.Component.changeset/2","type":"function"},{"doc":"Create a component from the given keyword list of options Note: While using this function directly, you are not guaranteed to produce a valid component and it is the responsibility of the user to ensure they are passing a valid combination of component attributes. eg. if you pass a button component both a custom_id , and a url , the component is invalid as only one of these fields is allowed.","ref":"Remedy.Schema.Component.html#c:new/1","title":"Remedy.Schema.Component.new/1","type":"callback"},{"doc":"Updates a component with the parameters provided.
